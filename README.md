# 📊 Task 4 – Insights and Recommendations

This task brings together the outputs of previous stages—sentiment analysis and thematic grouping—to generate actionable insights for three Ethiopian banking apps: **Dashen Bank**, **Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)**, and **Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)**. We use visualizations and evidence-based interpretation to suggest improvements and highlight key drivers of user satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze themes and sentiment to identify key pain points and drivers.
- Compare sentiment and review patterns across banks.
- Provide actionable, evidence-based recommendations.

### ❌ Key Pain Points

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Sentiment Distribution by Bank**  
  Bar plots showing positive, neutral, and negative sentiment per bank.

- **Review Theme Frequency**  
  Bar charts showing the number of reviews per theme (e.g., login, transaction, UI).

- **Word Clouds**  
  Generated for both positive and negative sentiment to visualize frequently used words.

  Displayed the frequency of 1–5 star ratings across each app.

- **Theme Sentiment Heatmaps**

## 🧠 Ethical Considerations

- Google Play reviews may overrepresent dissatisfied users, leading to a **negative sentiment skew**.
- Reviews do not represent the full user base (e.g., non-Play Store users, iOS users).
- Some reviews may reflect issues unrelated to the app (e.g., network problems).
